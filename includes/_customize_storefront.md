# Customize storefront

# Overview

Depending on the kind of application you integrate with Ecwid, you may want to customize user storefront in some way. For example:

* apply custom styles to the store elements (buttons, fonts, pictures etc.)
* add extra widgets, e.g. customer reviews, comments, image magnifier
* modify Ecwid widgets look and behavior
* add tracking pixels or any other third party conversion-tracking scripts at checkout page

Ecwid API allows you to attach external JavaScript and CSS scripts and load them automatically in a user storefront. 

**How it works and how to set up**

1. When [registering of your app in Ecwid](/register), you specify https URL of the `.css` or `.js` file (or both) you'd like to be loaded in user storefront. 
2. When asking user to install your app, Ecwid will ask for `customize_storefront` scope from them. (*If your app is for a specific store, make sure to add `customize_storefront` scope in the oAuth process*)
3. The next time user's storefront is loaded in any browser, the specified external JS/CSS files will be automatically loaded and executed on the page.

Below, you will find more information on how to create custom JS/CSS. See [Customizing Storefront guideline](/customizing-storefront) for more details about app review process.

# Custom JavaScript

> Example of custom JavaScript to modify storefront

```js
/*
 * Show a promo 'Free shipping' message on the cart page. 
 * In the example below, users will see a message on the cart page 
 * informing them that they will qualify for free shipping if their 
 * order is more than $99
 */

var promoMessage = "Orders $99 and up ship free!";
var minSubtotal = 99;
var widgets;

// Calculating subtotal and displaying the message
var checkSubtotal = function(order) {
  if (order) {
    var subtotal = order.total - order.shipping;
    if (subtotal < minSubtotal) {
      alert(promoMessage);
    }  
  }
}

// Detecting whether we're on the cart page and get the cart info
Ecwid.OnPageLoaded.add(function(page) {
  widgets = Ecwid.getInitializedWidgets();

  // if storefront widget is present on this page
  for (i = 0; i < widgets.length ; i++) {
    if (widgets[i] == "ProductBrowser") {
      
      if ('CART' == page.type) {
        Ecwid.Cart.calculateTotal(function(order) {
          checkSubtotal(order);
      });
    }
  }
});

// Get color value for the message and store it in color variable
var color = Ecwid.getAppPublicConfig(appId);

// your code here
// ...
```

As soon as your script is loaded on the page with Ecwid storefront, you can access the page DOM and do pretty much everything you want by means of native JavaScript or whatever framework you want. If you use a JS framework, please make sure it's already loaded on the page by the moment you start using it. 

In addition, Ecwid provides a [JavaScript API](#storefront-js-api) that you can use to retrieve store information and track Ecwid events on the page. For example:

* `Ecwid.getOwnerId()` returns the store ID. You may want to use it to identify which store your script is loaded in now
* `Ecwid.OnPageLoad()` and `Ecwid.OnPageLoaded()` help you to track store page switch and identify which page is opened
* `Ecwid.Cart` object and its methods allow to manage the customer cart
* `EcwidApp.getAppPublicConfig` will return store-specific data from application storage

More details: [Ecwid JavaScript API](#storefront-js-api)

### Q: How to know what Ecwid widgets are on a page?

If your applcation customizes storefront, your script will be loaded at **all times** when `app.ecwid.com/script.js?{store_id}` is on a page. It means that if a simple search widget is present on a page, your script will be executed. 

Ecwid widgets can be also embedded in many ways: 

- as a part of a website page
- in an iframe
- certain widgets are displayed only (like search and minicart, no storefront) 

So, it is important to know where exactly your application is loaded: if there is a storefront present on a page or if it's just a search widget. To check that, use `Ecwid.getInitializedWidgets()` function of [Ecwid Javascript API](#storefront-js-api). Using it, you can determine whether your app functionality needs to be initialized or not.

### Q: What is the best way to add new scripts from my code? 

> Add external script to the page example

```js
var s = document.createElement("script");
s.type = "text/javascript";
s.src = "https://example.com/example.js";
document.head.appendChild(s);
```

JavaScript is a very flexible programming language, that allows you to do the same thing in many different ways. For example, if you need to load additional external script on the page with your current code, you can do it in multiple ways too.

We recommend that you load external JS files using a standard function `createElement()`. See example code on the right. 
More details about this approach: [W3CSchools](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_document_createelement.asp)

<aside class="note">Please make sure to avoid using the <em>document.write()</em> function as it works synchronously and will slow down the page.</aside>

## Store-specific custom JS

> Example of the script that dynamically loads store-specific code

```js
// Load external script with store
function loadConfig(ecwidStoreId, callback) {
  var script = document.createElement("script");
  script.setAttribute("src", '//example.com/myapp/store' + ecwidStoreId + '.js');
  script.charset = "utf-8";
  script.setAttribute("type", "text/javascript");
  script.onreadystatechange = script.onload = callback;
  document.body.appendChild(script);
}

// Application functionality
function doCoolStuff() {
  //...
}

// Get color value for the message and store it in color variable
var color = Ecwid.getAppPublicConfig(appId);

// Get Ecwid store ID and start working
loadConfig(Ecwid.getOwnerId(), doCoolStuff);
```

In most cases, your application behavior will vary depending on the store it is opened in. Although Ecwid API allows you to specify only one JS file per application, your application can detect the current Ecwid store ID and act correspondingly. Use the `Ecwid.getOwnerId()` method to detect the user store ID in your script. 

For example, let's say you need to dynamically add a store-specific configuration to your script when it's executed in some particular storefront. You can detect the store ID in your script and call a script on your server containing the store-specific code. 

To get information for that specific store you can use `Ecwid.getAppPublicConfig` function in [Ecwid Javascript API](#storefront-js-api). See more details on how to access that data in **Application data** section of documentation.

## Using jQuery on store pages

> Checking for jQuery on a page example

```js
// function to load jQuery

function loadjQuery(){
  var jq = document.createElement('script'); jq.type = 'text/javascript';
  jq.src = '//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.2/jquery.min.js';
  document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(jq);
}

// check if jQuery is present on a page

if (typeof jQuery != 'undefined') {  

// check jQuery version loaded

   if (jQuery.fn.jquery != '1.12.2') {
      loadjQuery();

   } else {
      exit;
   }

} else {
  loadjQuery();
}

// your app code
// ...
```

jQuery is a very popular JavaScript library that is used in many websites. The developers of themes for Wordpress CMS, for example, include this library right into the theme to have access to its functions and to operate various HTML elements on the page easily.

Ecwid storefronts can be customized in many ways, for example: you can set specific behaviour for each [page or each user](https://help.ecwid.com/customer/portal/articles/1085558) that visits those pages. Some developers prefer using native JavaScript libraries to change the position or the display of certain elements and some of them use various versions of jQuery. 

To ensure that your jQuery version code doesn't conflict with other applications that change Ecwid storefront, you can use the code example on the right. It will allow you to check whether the page has a specific version of jQuery that you need and load it if required. 

We recommend loading your jQuery from your own server or from [Google's CDN](https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/#jquery) for jQuery to ensure it is available at all times.

# Custom CSS

> Example of custom CSS to modify storefront

```css
/*
 * Change Ecwid buttons style 
 */
button.gwt-Button, #wrapper button.gwt-Button { 
  border-radius: 13px; 
  -moz-border-radius: 13px; 
  -webkit-border-radius: 13px; 
  height: 28px; 
  background-color: #e4e4e4; 
  padding: 0 15px; 
}  
 
button.gwt-Button:active,
#wrapper button.gwt-Button:active { 
  background-color: #999999; 
}  
 
div.ecwid-productBrowser-details-rightPanel div.ecwid-productBrowser-backgroundedPanel {
  min-width:185px; 
  width:auto; 
}
```

Ecwid provides a merchant with a built-in CSS customization tool in their control panel in the 'Design' section: Ecwid automatically loads the CSS code entered by user in their storefront. This allows merchants to customize their store look and feel flexibly. See also ["How to change Ecwid design"](http://help.ecwid.com/customer/portal/articles/1083332-how-to-change-ecwid-design) article in our knowledge base.

Ecwid API allows you to do the same in more convenient way: you simply specify the URL of file with your custom CSS code and Ecwid automatically loads that code in the user storefront. So you don't need to put the CSS on user site manually or ask them to do that. 

## Store-specific custom CSS

You may want to apply different CSS codes depending on the store your application is loaded. For example, if your application provides new design themes for merchant storefront, you may need to give a merchant ability to choose the theme they want to enable and change the applied CSS code according to their choice. 

In such cases, you will need to use custom JS files to dynamically detect merchant store ID and load different styles depending on the user store ID. See [Custom JavaScript](#custom-javascript) for details.

# Access users’ data in storefront

Applications can work and look differently in various stores, so you can provide tailored user experience to the store owner and a website they have in your application.

App public config allows apps to access user specific data in storefront as soon as it starts to load, so no calls to external servers are required and result is available right away. It’s recommended that you use app storage to access public user data in storefront area of your application.

**How it works:**

1. App saves public data in public storage in backend
2. App gets public data from public storage in storefront
3. App tailors user experience to merchant settings

For example, using this method you can pass store ID to a storefront, category or product ID where the changes need to apply or whether your widget needs to be shown in storefront. 

To find out more about this process, please check [Public App Config](#public-application-config) section.
